This is a imperial to metric converter that I built during my summer job. I encountered many American customers who would describe their situations in imperial units, which was a bit confusing for me since I'm used to metric units. 
Since I was restricted to a single monitor and multiple tabs on my screen at once, I decided to build a small device that could do the conversions for me. 
The project overall made my workflow much more efficient and can be updated to include various different conversions as well.
